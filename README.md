## Problem 1
```(ruby)
def add(a, b)
  if a > b
    return a + b
  end

  a - b
end
```
1. This algorithm's number of operations doesn't depend on any of its inputs.
2. The time-complexity is O(1).
3. There are no worst cases because the time complexity is O(1).
4. The space-complexity is O(1) also..
